# Kern: A _simple_ yet effective image processing app

This is **Kern** a very simple and effective image processing application written entirely in Java.

The purpose of this project is to learn Java while re-writing a little project of mine. The idea is to add
more effects referring to the literature, and maybe even in the future fork this into a _computer vision_ software
that can handle machine learning and pattern recognition stuff.
